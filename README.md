## Project Overview

This project is the construction of a compiler for a simple programming language. We're building a compiler from scratch to deepen our understanding of how programming languages are processed and executed.

## Project Goals

1. Understand the fundamental stages of compilation
2. Implement each component of a basic compiler
3. Create a simple programming language to compile
4. Generate executable code or interpretable bytecode

## Compiler Stages

Our compiler will include the following stages:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizing the input source code
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Parsing tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Checking for semantic errors and type checking
4. **Intermediate Code Generation**: Creating an intermediate representation
5. **Code Optimization**: Improving the intermediate code (optional)
6. **Code Generation**: Producing the target code (e.g., assembly or bytecode)

## Programming Language Specification

Our simple programming language will support the following features:

1. **Variables**: Declaring and initializing variables
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
3. **Control Structures**: `if` statements, `for` loops
4. **Functions**: Defining and calling functions
